# EmployeeDetails_Web
I connected the Employee.php and Employee2.php with the Employee.php.
When you open the code run Employee.php and then click on the LOCATION button to view the "Location with respet to mean of aggregate salaries of employee.
then click on the HOME buttton to view the default details of Employees.
And then by using search box give the input as location name then click on submit.
Then it shows Employee details with respect to the location whichn is entered.
To view the all employee details click on HOME button on left side of the page.
And this is the working.
