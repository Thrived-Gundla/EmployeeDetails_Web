# EmployeeDetails_Web
### Working
I connected the Employee.php and Employee2.php with the **Employee1.php**.

When you open the code run *Employee1.php* and then click on the **LOCATION** button to view the Location with respect to mean of aggregated currSalary of employees.

Then click on the **HOME** buttton to view the default details of Employees data.

And then by using *search box* give the input as location name then click on submit button.

Then it display Employees details with respect to the location which is entered.

To view the all employee details click on *HOME* button.

And this is the working.
